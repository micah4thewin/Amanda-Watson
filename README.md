# Hello,

This website was designed for Amanda Watson. It is a simple front end using Bootstrap 5, AOS, and some custom styles/images/markup/scripts. 

This repository will be deleted, transferred, or made private at her request.

References to Amanda like her name, pictures, metadata, etc will be removed at her request.

# If you like it:
This website is hosted on Github pages for free.
A custom domain name can be connected at your request. (www.amandawatson.com, www.amandasavestheworld.com)
Anything you want to be added can be like a blog, forms, media, etc.
You can have many pages as you want.
I can change any aesthetics. Just tell me what you want and if I'm not getting it show me an example or draw a mockup.


# If you don't like it:
I promise my feeling aren't hurt. 
I am happy to change it however you like. Just give me some direction.
I can take it down.
I can remove references to you but keep it up.

#What I would need from you:
I need you to give me content like your bio, the image that you want, useful mental health resources, and some links or blog post content or whatever you think of. I can incorporate pretty much whatever you got and I like a challenge.

I am happy to change and edit this website for you as much as you need. You are also welcome to download the source files and do whatever you want with them.
