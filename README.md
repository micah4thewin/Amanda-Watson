# Start:

This website was designed for Amanda Watson. 
This repository will be deleted, transferred, or made private at her request.
References to Amanda like her name, pictures, metadata, etc will be removed at her request.

# About:

This is a static website created with the intention to get your professional online presence started. It is hosted on github. It is free. It's connected to a custom domain name. You can connect it to any domain you want though. I am willing to change it in whole or in part. If you opt not to have it at all I will remove it for you. 

# The Future: 

If you choose to keep this website you will want to give me content to occupy the placeholder content I created. To reduce effort I limited it to biographical and linked resources so you would just need to provide me with what you wanted. You are not limited however. Basically anything you want can be built.

This website can be connected to any domain you own and I can add whatever you want to it. 

# Your domain:

I purchased amandawatson.net from Google domains for one year. I can connect the site to any domain you choose though. I am happy to transfer amandawatson.net to your Google Domain account at your reaquest.

# Source Files:

I have published the source files to gihub as a public repository. You can download them from github in a zip folder or 'fork' the project into your own github project.
