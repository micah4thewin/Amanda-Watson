# About:,

This is a basic static website created with the intention to get your professional online presence started. It is hosted on github which is completely free and connected to a customer domain name I picked. I designed the website the way I think you would like. I am willing to change anything and everything about it if you don't in whole or in part. 

# Your domain:.

I purchased amandawatson.net from Google domains for one year. I can connect the site to any domain you choose though. I am happy to transfer the domain to your Google Domain account at your reaquest.

# Source Files:,

I have published the source files to gihub as a public repository. You can download them from github in a zip folder and do whatever you want with them or 'fork' the project into your own github repositories.  I am also happy to give them to you via usb drive later.
